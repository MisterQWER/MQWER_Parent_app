# This project helps simulate a series of interactions between parent and their child.

Features: 
- Kids:  Create, edit, and god forbid delete the kids through the menu.
         Create tasks and assign them to available kids. One a task is finished, the next kid in queue has to do it next time.

- Coin Flip: Either a kid will be chosen to call the flip or its just a normal flip.
             Toss or view the history of the coin flips.
             
- Timeout Timer: set a timer for any activity in real life and receive a notification when the timer ends
- Take Breaths: set a number and take a breather with the app and relax.
